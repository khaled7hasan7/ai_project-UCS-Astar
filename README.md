# Palestine Map Project

Welcome to the Palestine Map Project! This project is a Java-based program that provides a map of Palestine containing fifteen cities. The program is designed to find the shortest route between two cities using two different algorithms: Uniform Cost Search and A Star.

## Features

- Displays a map of Palestine with fifteen cities marked.
- Utilizes two algorithms, Uniform Cost Search and A Star, to find the shortest route between two cities.
- Provides detailed information about the shortest route found.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

     
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/palestine-map-project.git](https://github.com/khaled7hasan7/ai_project2.git)
 

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.

3. Compile and run the `mainAIProject.class` file to start the program.

## Usage

1. Upon running the program, you will be presented with a map of Palestine containing fifteen cities.
2. Enter the names of the two cities between which you want to find the shortest route.
3. Choose the algorithm (Uniform Cost Search or A Star) to find the route.
4. The program will display the shortest route along with detailed information such as distance, time, etc.

## Examples

After running the program, this destination will be cleared for you with dots indicating the fifteen cities. You can add another city or delete it through the cities file.<br>
      1:Now you choose the current city and the target city<br>
      2:You choose the search method<br>
      3:Press the run button<br>

## Algorithms

This project implements the following algorithms:

- **Uniform Cost Search**: An algorithm used for traversing a weighted graph or tree to find the cheapest path from a starting node to a goal node.
- **A Star (A*)**: A heuristic search algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between two nodes or vertices in a graph.
